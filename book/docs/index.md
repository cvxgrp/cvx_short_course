# CVX Short Course

   

## Applications of convex optimization

   * Present applications in finance, machine learning, vehicle control, and risk analysis.
   * For each application, the instructors will give a motivating overview, and participants will then code up and solve
   a problem arising in the application using CVXPY. Concretely, exercises will consist of notebooks with missing
   sections, which the participants need to fill in with code constructing and solving a CVXPY problem.
