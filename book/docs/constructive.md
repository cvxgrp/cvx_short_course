# Constructive convex analysis

* Mathematically define convex, concave, and affine functions. Give many examples.
* Introduce the composition rule for convex, concave, and affine functions, which generates the grammar for
  CVXPY.
* Introduce Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP).
* Learn how to construct convex optimization problems using DCP in CVXPY.
