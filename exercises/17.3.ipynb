    "Flux balance analysis is based on a very simple model of\n",
    "the reactions going on in a cell, keeping track only of the gross rate of consumption and production\n",
    "of various chemical species within the cell. Based on the known stoichiometry of the reactions, and\n",
    "known upper bounds on some of the reaction rates, we can compute bounds on the other reaction\n",
    "rates, or cell growth, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on m metabolites in a cell, labeled $M_1, \\ldots, M_m$. There are $n$ reactions going on, labeled\n",
    "$R_1, \\ldots, R_n$, with nonnegative reaction rates $v_1, \\ldots, v_n$. Each reaction has a (known) stoichiometry,\n",
    "which tells us the rate of consumption and production of the metabolites per unit of reaction rate.\n",
    "The stoichiometry data is given by the *stoichiometry matrix* $S \\in \\mathbf{R}^{m \\times n}$, defined as follows: $S_{ij}$\n",
    "is the rate of production of $M_i$ due to unit reaction rate $v_j = 1$. Here we consider consumption\n",
    "of a metabolite as negative production; so $S_{ij} = −2$, for example, means that reaction $R_j$ causes\n",
    "metabolite $M_i$ to be consumed at a rate $2v_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose reaction $R_1$ has the form $M_1 \\rightarrow M_2 + 2M_3$. The consumption rate of $M_1$,\n",
    "due to this reaction, is $v_1$; the production rate of $M_2$ is $v_1$; and the production rate of $M_3$ is $2v_1$.\n",
    "(The reaction $R_1$ has no effect on metabolites $M_4, \\ldots, M_m$.) This corresponds to a first column of\n",
    "$S$ of the form $(−1, 1, 2, 0, \\ldots, 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactions are also used to model flow of metabolites into and out of the cell. For example, suppose\n",
    "that reaction $R_2$ corresponds to the flow of metabolite $M_1$ into the cell, with $v_2$ giving the flow\n",
    "rate. This corresponds to a second column of $S$ of the form $(1, 0, \\ldots, 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last reaction, $R_n$, corresponds to biomass creation, or cell growth, so the reaction rate $v_n$ is\n",
    "the cell growth rate. The last column of $S$ gives the amounts of metabolites used or created per\n",
    "unit of cell growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our reactions include metabolites entering or leaving the cell, as well as those converted\n",
    "to biomass within the cell, we have conservation of the metabolites, which can be expressed as\n",
    "$Sv = 0$. In addition, we are given upper limits on some of the reaction rates, which we express as\n",
    "$v \\preceq v^\\mathrm{max}$, where we set $v^\\mathrm{max}_j = \\infty$ if no upper limit on reaction rate $j$ is known. The goal is to\n",
    "find the maximum possible cell growth rate (i.e., largest possible value of $v_n$) consistent with the\n",
